# Big Data Assignment
prepared By : Firomsa Fekadu    ID No: DBU/041/14

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of a large e-commerce dataset, utilizing Big Data techniques and tools to extract meaningful insights. The data, which contains over a million records, is processed using PySpark, transformed, and stored in DuckDB. Visualizations and insights are presented using Power BI, connected to DuckDB through a Python script.

## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Extraction**: The dataset, titled "Olist", was downloaded from an external data provider. The data was read into a DataFrame using PySpark for efficient handling and processing of large-scale datasets.

2. **Data Transformation**:
    - Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring proper formatting of data types.
    - Managed inconsistencies and errors to prepare the dataset for analysis.

3. **Data Loading**:
    - Loaded the data into permanent CSV files for backup and future use.
    - Imported the data into DuckDB, a high-performance database, for fast querying and analysis.

4. **Data Visualization & Insights**:
    - Utilized Power BI to create interactive and insightful visualizations.
    - Visualized key metrics such as sales trends, customer distributions, and seller information, among others.
    - Connected Power BI to DuckDB using a Python script, enabling seamless access to the database for real-time analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **PySpark**: For data extraction, transformation, and cleaning.
- **DuckDB**: A high-performance database used to store and query the data.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- **Python**: To integrate Power BI with DuckDB for seamless data connection.
